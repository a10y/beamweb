BeamWeb: Beam Pages from iPhone to Computer
===========================================

Wrote this in about 4 hours, it's a (really really) simple browser that you can run on your iPhone, and allows you to
flick pages from your device onto your laptop. Maybe I'll post a video demo at some point.

Still a rough draft.

TODO:
-----

- [x] Make initial mockup
- [ ] Convert server into Chrome extension
- [ ] Add settings pane in the iOS app to change IP/Port without changing code
